# YOLOv8 Object Tracking in Video

This Python script uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) to detect and track objects in a video. It loads a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, processes each frame of the video, tracks objects, and displays the results in real time.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- ultralytics package (for YOLOv8)
- OpenCV (cv2 package)
